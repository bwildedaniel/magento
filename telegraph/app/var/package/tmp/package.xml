    <summary>Hide Price and Add to Cart for Guests Users</summary>
    <description>Many a times in an ecommerce website, we do not wish the guest users to know the price of the catalog products. The solution to this problem is rather easy. What we just need to do is first of all figure out where the product prices are shown. Then hide them from guest users. While we are at it we will also hide the &#x2018;Add to Cart&#x2019; and 'Product Price' buttons everywhere (for guest users). In magento by default price is shown on following places&#xD;
&#xD;
&#x2022; Category list page (where all the product of a category are listed).&#xD;
&#x2022; Product view page (where product details are shown).&#xD;
&#x2022; Compare pop up (where two or more products are compared side by side).&#xD;
&#xD;
Hide Product Price for Guest Users Magento Extension hides the product price for Non-Registered Users and show only for logged in users. Only registered users will be able to view the price and add to cart to checkout. Having this feature encourages users to register in the website, leading to more Customers versus Guests users.&#xD;
Features:&#xD;
&#xD;
Encourages Customers to Log-in:&#xD;
Blocks the Navigational users to view of the price of your products. Also, they cannot add any items to the Cart. Due to this, customers will be encouraged to login to get to know the price details&#xD;
&#xD;
Denies your competitors to know the Price of your Products&#xD;
It denies your competitors access to the price by simply navigating around and doesn't dissipate the vital information on your products Price.&#xD;
&#xD;
Display customized messages instead of &#x201C;Add to Cart&#x201D;&#xD;
Instead of just hiding &#x201C;Add to Cart&#x201D; button you can customize it. Just manage messages that would be displayed instead of price and &#x2018;Add to cart&#x2019; button. This will help you create a more personal approach and increase your revenue.</description>
